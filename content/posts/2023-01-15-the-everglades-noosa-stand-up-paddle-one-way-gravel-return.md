  title: The adventure on stand up paddle board and gravel ride
---
We set off on a new paddle board adventure up the Noosa Everglades. Taking on an eighth kilometre paddle board option from Boreen Point up to the river system we finished up at Harry’s Hut. We had our ute parked up and returned back driving back via gravel road but we’d definitely be back on the bikes for the next level experience.

**About Noosa Everglades**

This hidden gem in Queensland is quite a special place. The narrow channels and secluded lagoons are surrounded by wetlands and dense mangroves. This unique water system is a perfect spot to escape the mainstream and embrace nature in all its raw beauty.

Stand-up paddling in the Noosa Everglades offers a peaceful experience. You get this close-up view of the diverse ecosystem and the opportunity to explore the hidden gems of the area.
