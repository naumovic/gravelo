Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to gravelo!

We are Mihajlo and Jason, two Australian friends exploring the world on gravel bikes, stand-up paddle boards and surf spots. Join us as we embark on a journey filled with endless discovery and breathtaking experiences. From the rugged Australian outback to the crystal-clear waters of exotic beaches, we're on a mission to seek out the world's most incredible destinations and share our journey with you. Get ready for a wild ride as we share our tales of exploration, adventure, and the friendships forged along the way.

> ### What is gravelo?

The gravelo is a travel journal of two Australian friends exploring the world on gravel roads.

As we were exploring some of Australian gravel roads, we started saying gravelo (gravel-/oh) quite a bit, referring to a gravel bike. And it stuck. So when it came time to go live and share these adventures with the rest of the world, it seemed like a natural fit to name the website gravelo.

There are always great great we either want to explore or have already explored. So we wanted to create a simple way to see all places in the one spot and be able to add to it.

> ### Is gravelo missing a place?

We've made the list open to the world so anyone can contribute to it.
